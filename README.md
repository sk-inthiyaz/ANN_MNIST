# ANN_MNIST
Number recognization with Artificial Neural Network

## Overview
This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning and consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9) in grayscale.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to normalize the pixel values and reshape the images for input into the ANN.
- **Model Architecture**: The ANN consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The architecture can be customized based on the user's requirements.
- **Training**: The model is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent optimization techniques.
- **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics on a test dataset.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ANN_MNIST.git
